# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease using machine learning techniques on the Kaggle Heart Disease dataset.

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Contains the raw dataset CSV (heart.csv).
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Model Training.
- `scripts/` - Modular Python scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- `models/` - Saved machine learning models and scalers.
- `outputs/` - Generated model predictions and plots.
- `docs/` - Project documentation including this README and dataset description.
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies.

## Usage

1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.
2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the EDA notebook `notebooks/01_eda.ipynb` to understand the data.
4. Build and evaluate models using `notebooks/02_model_training.ipynb` or scripts in `scripts/`.
5. Models are saved in `models/` folder for reuse or deployment.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Kaggle Heart Disease dataset (`data/heart.csv`) which contains 303 records with 14 attributes related to clinical and demographic patient data.
